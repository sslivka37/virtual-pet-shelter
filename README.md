# virtual-pet-shelter
virtual pet shelter module 3 project
**HP Lovecraft's Virtual Pet Shelter by Sarah Slivka 1/28/19**
In this project I ran unit tests on all of the methods(add a pet, remove a pet, play with one pet, feed all pets, water all pets)
All Virtual Pets have the instance variables of name, hunger level, thirst level, happiness level, and a description
The VirtualPetApp houses the user interface and the menu

in the future I may clean up the code and house the menu in a separate class
